# threejs-demo (wip)

An attempt at learning [Three.js](https://threejs.org) with [Svelte Cubed](https://svelte-cubed.vercel.app) â€” the intention was to build someting cool within half a day, but I ran out of inspiration :") 

(I will resume this soon!)

## Set-up

Enter the following commands to install required dependencies and start a development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the application in your browser.
